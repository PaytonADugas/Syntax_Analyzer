# Syntax_Analyzer
I think there's a reasonable amount of uneccessary code in chapter 4 that I didn't include in here.  I reinvented all the code written here.  

If you clone the repo and run the code, you'll see everything working but any variable names are listed by every letter.
That's becasue I couldn't reassign variables and concatinate the chars...  Seriously R...?!  For some reason.  If someone else figures that out, great!

To run the file, just type Rscript lex_an.r and it'll spit out the answers.  You can edit the expression in the code.txt file

In the book, there's a variable called ASSUGn_OP which I assume is "=" but it's never used.  So, I don't think we have to implement that?


Also, I really don't think I like R as a language, so we'll see how our project goes along.  I'm not sure if it's just poorly implemented or if it's
supposed to serve a completely different service than creating a parser.  I'd guess the later.
