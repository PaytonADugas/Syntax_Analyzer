# Syntax_Analyzer
I think there's a reasonable amount of uneccessary code in chapter 4 that I didn't include in here.  I reinvented all the code written here.  

Also, I really don't think I like R as a language, so we'll see how our project goes along.  I'm not sure if it's just poorly implemented or if it's
supposed to serve a completely different service than creating a parser.  I'd guess the later. 

If you clone the repo and run the code, you'll see everything working but any variable words are listed by every letter.
That's becasue I couldn't reassign variables and concatinate the chars...  For some reason.  If someone else figures that out, great!

To run the file, just type Rscript lex_an.r and it'll spit out the answers
